                    The US is sending special forces to Syria to assist anti-government rebels in fighting
                    the so-called Islamic State (IS), officials have said.There will be "fewer than 50"
                    forces deployed in the region to "train, advise and assist" vetted opposition forces,
                    said officials.This will be the first time US troops are working openly on the ground
                    in Syria.But there have been US special forces raids on IS militants there.A senior
                    administration official told the BBC this does not signal a change in US strategy but an
                    "intensification" of the campaign."Our role fundamentally and the strategy is to enable
                    local forces but does that put US forces in harm's way? It does, no question about it,"
                    Defence Secretary Ash Carter later told reporters. However, Russia's foreign minister
                    warned that the move increased the risk of a "proxy war" developing in the region and
                    urged greater co-operation between the US and Russian militaries."I am convinced that
                    neither the United States nor Russia of course want any kind of slide into a so-called
                    proxy war," said Sergei Lavrov, speaking after talks with US Secretary of State John
                    Kerry and UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura in Vienna.For more than a year, the US
                    and coalition forces have been carrying out air strikes against IS, which controls a
                    large part of northern Syria and parts of neighbouring Iraq. The US recently abandoned
                    its Syria rebel training effort, opting to provide equipment and arms directly to rebel
                    leaders instead. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Obama wanted to
                    provide additional support for Syrian rebel fighters who had been having success on the
                    battlefield. "There are now moderate opposition forces that are 45 miles (72km) outside
                    Raqqa," he said. "The president is prepared to intensify the elements that have shown
                    promise." He added: "This is an intensification of a strategy he discussed a year ago."
                    The numbers are small, nonetheless the US decision represents a notable shift in US
                    policy. Their mission will be "to help co-ordinate local ground forces and coalition
                    efforts" against IS in northern Syria. In all likelihood they may fight alongside
                    Kurdish forces who have been the most effective of Washington's local allies.
                    "Co-ordination" could well mean forward air controllers; teams trained in the skills of
                    linking up tactical air power with troops on the ground; designating targets and calling
                    in strikes. The fact that the US now has specialised A-10 ground attack aircraft
                    reasonably close by at the Turkish air base of Incirlik may also be significant. This
                    is a small step intended not least to reassure Washington's unsettled allies in the
                    region. The drift in US policy has become even more apparent since Russia's muscular
                    intervention from the air. But to be convincing the US may need to do a good deal more
                    and that seems to be at variance with President Obama's basic instincts.

                    And so the best team won. And it wasn't Australia. Hurrah. For the third time, the New
                    Zealand All Blacks are the Rugby Union World Champions. On one side of the Tasman Sea
                    this morning, there will be bleary-eyed celebrations, dancing/staggering in the streets
                    of Wellington and Christchurch. On the other, there will probably be a shrug of the
                    shoulders and a communal cry of "Am I bovvered? It's a rubbish sport anyway. Let's go
                    to the beach." As somebody who has lived in both Australia and New Zealand for a number
                    of years, I can tell you this result will matter far more to the Kiwis than it will for
                    the Aussies. While rugby union is a veritable religion in New Zealand, the ins and outs
                    of the All Blacks side featuring in just about every national news bulletin, in
                    Australia the game plays very much third fiddle in popularity to Rugby League and Aussie
                    Rules, not to mention cricket and increasingly football (or soccer as they insist on
                    calling it here.) The current Australian team has tried to brand itself as the "Working
                    Class Wallabies", with a number of players from the Pacific Islands. But for the most
                    part, the game is still followed by the upper echelons of Australian society. The
                    thinking man's game.

                    Searchers say they believe they have found the wreckage of a cargo ship which went
                    missing off the Bahamas during Hurricane Joaquin last month. The 790ft (241m) El Faro
                    disappeared while sailing from Florida to Puerto Rico with 33 crew on board. A US Navy
                    ship using sonar equipment has now located a vessel at a depth of 15,000ft. The El Faro
                    sent out a distress signal on 1 October, saying it had lost power and was taking on
                    water. Debris was spotted in the ocean in the days after it disappeared, and one body
                    was recovered. In a statement, the US National Transportation Safety Board said a
                    remotely operated vehicle would be deployed "to survey and confirm the identity of the
                    wreckage". It added that the wreckage was "consistent with a 790ft cargo ship, which
                    from sonar images appears to be in an upright position and in one piece". The statement
                    went on to say that if the wreckage was confirmed to be the missing cargo ship, attempts
                    would be made to locate and recover the voyage data recorder.

                    Rain in Brisbane held up Australia's pursuit of victory on day four after they set New
                    Zealand a world record target of 504 to win the first Test. The hosts declared on their
                    overnight total of 264-4, but rain forced an early lunch with the Kiwis 48-1. Opener
                    Martin Guptill resisted for 133 balls for his 23, while Kane Williamson added 59 to his
                    first-innings 140 but fell just before tea. The rain returned to wash out the final
                    session with the Black Caps on 142-3. With only 53 overs possible on day four, the
                    fifth and final day will start half-an-hour earlier at 23:30 GMT.
